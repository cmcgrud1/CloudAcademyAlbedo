Column 1 ->   model layer (corresponding to midpoints in PT space between the levels specified in the *.pt file)
TMID=0.5d0*(TEMP(J)+TEMP(J+1)) 
PMID=DSQRT(PRESS(J)*PRESS(J+1))

Column 2 ->  wavelength bin (standard 196 wavelength bins)
Column 3 ->  optical depth of the cloud/haze (at each layer and wavelength bin)
Column 4 ->  asymmetry factor (g) of cloud/haze (at each layer and wavelength bin)
Column 5 -> single scattering albedo of cloud/haze (wbar) (at each layer and wavelength bin)
